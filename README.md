M3CoreData
==========

M3CoreData adds a series of extensions to the CoreData framework. It consists of 3 items:

- **M3CoreDataManager** Hides away all the usual CoreData setup code into a separate class
- **M3JSONAtomicStore** Adds support for JSON based data stores
- **NSManagedObjectContext+M3Extensions** Adds some methods to simplify adding/retrieving objects

M3CoreData is licensed under the MIT framework


M3JSONAtomicStore Format
------------------------

M3JSONAtomicStore requires a specific structure on disk. Stores are folders, which contain the following:

- A **_Metadata.json** file for storing store metadata
- A JSON file for each entity called <<entity name>>.json

Each entity JSON file has a root dictionary. This dictionary contains the ID (an integer) as the key and the object data (another dictionary) as the value. The object data contains the key-value pairs for the stored object. To many relationships should be represented as an array of IDs. Dates should be strings in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss Â±hhmm.

Relationships are defined with simple IDs, in the format "<<entity name>>.<<object id>>".

While this store can potentially be used in production code, I would urge caution as it hasn't been extensively tested. It's primary aim is to seed test data into a Core Data store.
